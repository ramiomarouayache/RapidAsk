You can create your own speaking character using an image or video. In this tutorial, we'll focus on two excellent platforms: Heygen and Vidnoz, both offering AI-driven avatar creation features.

1. First, login on Heygen or sign up from [here](https://heygen.com/?sid=rewardful&via=rami-omar). You'll find a variety of ready-made avatars to choose from, ranging from realistic to cartoon styles.

2. **Create Your Avatar Video**  
   After preparing your image, convert it into a speaking avatar video.  
   - Navigate to **Avatars > Video Avatars > Create Avatar** and upload your image.  
   - **Important**: Always check the personal and commercial use rights to ensure compliance with your app.

#### 2. **Using a Video (Recommended)**

Once you've created your MP4 avatar (with mouth and face movements), the next step is to remove the background. 

Several tools can help with background removal:

- [Unscreen](https://www.unscreen.com/)
- [BackgroundRemoverAI](https://www.backgroundremoverai.com/?lang=en)
- [BackgroundRemoverAI (python)](https://github.com/nadermx/backgroundremover)

We recommend BackgroundRemoverAI as itâ€™s free, accurate, and open-source, so you can run it locally or on hosted environments like Google Colab.

After uploading your MP4 to BackgroundRemoverAI plateform, you'll receive a transparent GIF file (since MP4 doesn't support transparent backgrounds).

#### 3. **Optimize Your GIF File**

To convert the GIF into a Lottie file, ensure itâ€™s under **10 MB**. If itâ€™s too large, use the following tools to optimize it:

- [EZGif](https://ezgif.com/optimize)

In EZGif, you can crop and resize the GIF to reduce file size without losing too much quality.

**Important Optimization Tools**:

1. **Crop Tool**: Remove unnecessary empty spaces around the character.

2. **Resize Tool**: Reduce the width of the GIF to fit your use case (e.g., 600-720px for mobile or 720-900px for web). This will reduce the file size.

3. **Optimize Tool**: This tool compresses the GIF using the Gifsicle and Lossy GIF encoder. You can adjust the compression level (0-200) to reduce the file size by 30-50%.

:::tip[Convert MP4 to PNG Sequence (Optional)]

If you prefer, you can convert your MP4 video into a sequence of PNGs and perform operations on them in bulk, such as removing backgrounds or vectorizing the images. Afterward, you can convert the results(frames) back into a GIF or APNG.

While this method gives you more control, it requires more tools and time. For simplicity, we recommend converting your video directly into a GIF.

#### 4. **Convert to Lottie File**

After optimizing the GIF, head to the official LottieFiles platform to convert it to a Lottie file.

- Upload the GIF to [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/).
- Follow the steps shown in the images below to get your Lottie CDN link.
