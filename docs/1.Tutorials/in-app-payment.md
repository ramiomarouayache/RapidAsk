### 1. How Stripe Subscription Works
When a user initiates a checkout session, Stripe creates a customer and links their email to their account. The user completes the payment on Stripeâ€™s secure page, and once processed, a webhook updates their subscription status in Firestore via Firebase Cloud Functions.


### 2. **Set Up Your Stripe Subscription**

- **In your Stripe dashboard: Create new Product:**

   - Go to `Products` in the sidebar and click `Add product`.
   - Fill out the necessary details, such as the name of the product and description.
   - Under `Pricing`, create the subscription pricing plans. For example, RapidAsk uses two pricing models: $8.99 per month / $19.99 per 3 months
   - Click `Save` to create the product and get the product ID and price ID for your plans.(you will be able to add more pricings after saving)

- **Connect your product ID with FlutterFlow actions**

   - Navigate to the `SubscriptionPage` in FlutterFlow.
   - For each subscription option (e.g., monthly, 3 months), go to the `onTap` action and set the appropriate `Price ID` (e.g., `price_1QXk3w*******`). You can find these IDs in your Stripe Dashboard under the productâ€™s pricing section.
   - ensure it's the same `Price ID` to control UI elements, like toggling the `container_border` (ui widgets) and showing a `checkmark_icon` to indicate the selected option.

   Make sure each pricing option is properly linked to the corresponding price ID, as this determines which plan the user selects during checkout.

- **Set Up the Checkout Session API Request**

   - In your FlutterFlow app, set up the **Checkout Session API request**. This request will initiate the Stripe checkout session when a user selects a subscription option.
   - The API request should pass the appropriate price ID, as well as other necessary parameters such as the user's email and the **success** and **cancel** URLs. 

   Make sure to set up these URLs correctly:
   - **Success URL**: This URL is where users are redirected after completing the payment successfully. You should create a "Thank You" or confirmation page in your app and use its URL here.
   - **Cancel URL**: This URL is where users are sent if they cancel the payment. Make sure to create a cancellation page in your app and use its URL here.

- **Handle Webhooks in Firebase Cloud Functions**

   - After the user makes a payment, Stripe will send a webhook to your Firebase Cloud Function to notify you of the payment status.
   - All the necessary functions to handle webhooks are already included in the **FCF section** of the FlutterFlow template you received. These functions will update the `subscriptionStatus` field in Firestore based on the payment events (such as `active`, `canceled`, `failed`, etc.).

### 3. **After Payment**

- **Successful Payment**: After a successful payment, the Firebase Cloud Function listens for the `checkout.session.completed` event and updates the `subscriptionStatus` field in Firestore to reflect the new subscription status (e.g., `active`).
  
- **Failed Payment**: If a payment fails, the Cloud Function listens for the `invoice.payment_failed` event and updates the `subscriptionStatus` to `failed`. You can handle failed payments however you prefer, such as alerting the user or suspending their subscription.

- **Subscription Cancellation**: If a user cancels their subscription, the relevant webhook event (`customer.subscription.deleted`) will be triggered, and the Cloud Function will update the `subscriptionStatus` to `canceled`.

### 4. **Testing Your Integration**

Before going live, itâ€™s crucial to test the Stripe integration:

1. **Use Stripe's Test Mode**: In the Stripe Dashboard, make sure youâ€™re in **Test Mode** when testing your payments and webhooks.
2. **Stripe Test Cards**: Use Stripeâ€™s test card numbers to simulate successful and failed payments. For example:
   - **Successful payment**: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Visa)
   - **Failed payment**: `4000 0000 0000 9995` (Card declined)

3. **Webhook Testing**: Use the Stripe CLI or Dashboard to trigger webhook events (e.g., payment success, payment failure) and make sure the Firebase Cloud Function handles them correctly.
