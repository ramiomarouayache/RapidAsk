  <summary>Response customization...</summary>
    
    You can customize bot responses in two different ways, depending on your needs:
    
    - **Basic Customization**: you can customize the entry prompt by adding any additional information you need, like in the example below:
      ![prompt](/img/prompt.webp)
      
    This way, your bot will always:
    - generate a response that could be read in about 13 seconds.
    - end its response with a small question to keep the conversation going.
    - introduce himself as "RapidAsk bot".

    - **Advanced Customization**: OpenAI lets you fine-tune models with your own data to tailor responses to your specific needs. For example, if you‚Äôre building a medical bot, you can train the model using your medical FAQs or answers to improve its accuracy. After uploading your dataset (ex: text, pdf, media, links...) and training the model, you can access it via an API endpoint.
