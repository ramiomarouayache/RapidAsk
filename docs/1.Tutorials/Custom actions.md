This action stops the speech-to-text recording and processes the text from the user‚Äôs speech.

- **Modifying Actions**: All actions are commented line by line. You can easily change them based on your specific needs (e.g., changing the API key, altering the recording duration, etc.).
- **Adding New Features**: If you need to add more functionality, simply update the code in these actions. FlutterFlow allows you to directly modify these actions and expand them as needed.
- You also can adjust the audio tone to make it more cartoonish by applying pitch-shifting filters to the MP3 voice.
